**B**eginning on my first page, i call upon[^1] the chorus
from helicon[^2] to come down into my heart, for the songs sake
which just now i have set down in tablets upon my knees,
the illimitable strife, the war-goading work of ares,[^3]
beseeching them to bring to the ears of all mankind
how the mice went among the frogs, proudly in their war-strength,
emulating the deeds of those earth-born men, the giants,[^4]
as the story among mortals once had it; and in this way it began.

[^1]: ɪ ᴄᴀʟʟ ᴜᴘᴏɴ: both the *iliad* and *odyssey* begin with an appeal to the muse for inspir­ation. hesiod addresses the muses in the first line of the *w&d*, and in the *theogony* goes so far as to describe how they met him face to face and conferred the gift of poetry upon him. ten of the homeric hymns begin by invoking the muse or muses :-

[^2]: ᴄʜᴏʀᴜs ғʀᴏᴍ ʜᴇʟɪᴄᴏɴ: consciously  anti-homeric—the muses in homer live on olympus (11.491, xi.218, etc.), and only appear on helicon from hes. *theog*. 2  onwards:+

[^3]: ᴡᴀʀ-ɢᴏᴀᴅɪɴɢ ᴡᴏʀᴋ ᴏғ ᴀʀᴇs: the expression is not altogether natural: the work of ares should be war, but this yields the sense war-rousing war :-

[^4]: ɢɪᴀɴᴛs: presumably a reference to the *gigantomachy*, the only mythological conflict in which the giants were involved, which was a popular theme in both literature and art. on a literary level, there is obvious point in the proem of a short comic work likening its protagonists to great and terrible monsters.

once a mouse, thirsty from escaping the close danger
of a weasel, plunged his greedy muzzle in a mill-pond,
delighting in the honey-sweet water; but a much-renowned
pond-lover saw him, and spoke to him as follows:

> stranger, who are you? whence come you to this shore? who begat you?
> tell me the whole truth, nor let me catch you in falsehood.
> for if i find you a worthy friend, i shall take you to my palace;
> i will give you gifts of guest-friendship, goodly and numerous.
> i myself am king physignathus, who across the mill-pond
> am honoured for all my days as the ruler of the frogs;
> and my father peleus raised me, having lain in loving union
> with hydromedusa by the banks of the eridanus river.
> and i see that you too are fine and valiant beyond others.

then in turn psicharpax spoke to him and made answer:

> why do you ask of my birthright? it is well-known among all
> mortal men, and gods, and the winged things in the heavens.
> by name i am called psicharpax; and i am the son
> of troxartes, a great-hearted father; and my mother
> is leichomyle, the daughter of king pternotroctes...
